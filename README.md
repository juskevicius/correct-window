1. Add the extension to Chrome profile (will have to add different extensions to all profiles, specify different foreign urls for each)
2. Follow https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/native-messaging to setup the native client
 in my case the native client config is located in:

/etc/opt/chrome/native-messaging-hosts/com.mantas.windows.json

contents:


{
  "name": "com.mantas.windows",
  "description": "Open links in specific browser window",
  "path": "/home/??????????????????????/correct-window/native-app.mjs",
  "type": "stdio",
  "allowed_origins": [
    "chrome-extension:///??????????????????????//",
    "chrome-extension:///??????????????????????//",
    "chrome-extension:///??????????????????????//"
  ]
}
